Hi Team,

As part of the CD-Tools team, we are receiving our tickets in SCTASK. We are facing the following challenges where we need assistance from your team:

We are unable to read the entire content in one go in the description mentioned in the variable part.
We are unable to filter by priority when creating reports.
Can we get the visual task board in SNOW for creating a Kanban board?
If possible, please schedule a brief call so I can demonstrate my queries practically.

I would appreciate your prompt assistance with these issues.

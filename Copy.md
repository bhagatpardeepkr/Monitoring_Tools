Current Monitoring Methodology and Challenges

Previous Approach:

Health Monitoring via Separate Dashboards: Previously leveraged individual dashboards for Splunk, Grafana, and Dynatrace within Grafana, complicating access and management.
Current Issues:

Observing Multiple Metrics Across Various Hosts/Servers: Monitoring assorted metrics for different technological stacks, significantly increasing time consumption.
Challenges Identified:

Fragmented Data Access: Difficulty in swiftly navigating between separate dashboards to gather insights.
Increased Troubleshooting Time: Problems in pinpointing issues due to non-integrated data views.

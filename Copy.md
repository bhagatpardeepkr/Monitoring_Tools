Regarding the on-call schedule in SNOW, I have conducted some research and found that the issue might not be due to manual changes. This inconsistency spans the whole year of 2025, specifically the weekend offshore shifts, which is unusual. Typically, when we make manual adjustments, they are only for 1 or 2 days to accommodate someone's leave. However, this issue persists throughout the entire year, which is strange. Below is a screenshot for January and February 2025. May I schedule a 30-minute meeting today if you have time?

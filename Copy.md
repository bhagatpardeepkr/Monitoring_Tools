A 401 error, often referred to as "401 Unauthorized" or "HTTP Status 401 â€“ Unauthorized," indicates that the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.

Here are some reasons you might encounter a 401 error while logging in:

Incorrect Credentials: The most common cause is entering an incorrect username or password. Double-check your login credentials to make sure they're correct.

Expired Session: If your session has expired due to inactivity, you might receive a 401 error after trying to perform an action that needs authentication.

Incorrect or Missing Authorization Header: The server may expect an authorization header that the client did not provide or provided incorrectly.

Incorrect Permissions: Your user account may not have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

Issues with Third-Party Login: If you're using a third-party service to log in (like Google or Facebook authentication), there could potentially be issues with the token generation or validation process.

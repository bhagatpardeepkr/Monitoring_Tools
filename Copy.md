We already have the SOP in place for Grafana and Dynatrace to change the generic IDs. For Grafana, we use 'Grafana ID,' and for Dynatrace, we use 'admin' and 'APMadmin.' We change the passwords every 90 days, and I donâ€™t believe this impacts the process. For security compliance, we are changing only these ID passwords for Grafana and Dynatrace. To my knowledge, our EPAM team does not manage or handle the Splunk password.

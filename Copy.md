Can we proceed with MZ creation for the user's request using the same code?
Regarding RUM enablement, I see that the code has been fixed, and we now have separate codes for Pre-Prod and Prod environments.
Can we start onboarding the user for RUM enablement in the non-prod environment without requiring a CR?
For the production environment, we will create a change request (CR) and proceed with the same process.

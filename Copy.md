Create a change request to implement this in the Prod environment.
Schedule the change for next week, aiming to complete it as soon as possible.
Once it’s deployed in Prod, we’ll present a demo to the Leadership team to gather broader feedback and suggestions.
After getting the green light from Leadership, we can proceed to make it Generally Available (GA).
Note:
We will not discuss or roll this out as GA until it has been fully implemented and reviewed by the Leadership team.

This task was assigned to one of the team members, who forgot to execute the task on time. However, we have not yet crossed the expiry date. We have implemented the new SSL certificate on the dev and clone environments and have created a change request for production. We are waiting for the CCR meeting. Once we get the approval, we will implement the changes on production as well tomorrow morning.

In this case, I cannot directly say it is our mistake because we currently lack a process where we implement changes first on development/clone environments and then on production. We have a global setting in our Git repository where we implement everything across all environments simultaneously; there are no pre and post checks for applications to verify changes. Overall, I can say that itâ€™s due to a process that was not accurately implemented. We have made the same changes for 20+ applications, and they were successfully implemented without any issues. Here, the issue arose due to the application behavior where Dynatrace broke due to RUM enablement.

The only point is that the application broke when we implemented the RUM enablement. The process requires creating a PR, which then Alu Abhijeet has to review/approve. After approval, the changes can be pushed to the main branch.

Next plan of action: Alu Abhijeet is creating the Terraform code. He is attempting to refine it or segregate the implementation by environment, so it does not directly affect all environments.

Yes, currently we have a daily DSU, but in the current meetings, mostly the EJ SMEs discuss their project work. At the end, the EJ SMEs ask EPAM if any support is needed. This proposal was created at Stephen's request because he mentioned that there is no need for us to join the current DSU. Instead, we can plan a separate session for EPAM support where we can seek assistance on support-related issues. For this reason, I have created a proposal for meetings on alternate days. I will forward the same to Stephen for approval.

Yes, it was strange. I was also wondering why we did not receive any pager alerts for this incident. Just for your information, this month we are providing on-shore on-call coverage from the off-shore team on alternate weeks. I remember we made some manual changes, but it is strange how it broke. I will need to check with my team to see if anyone made any specific changes for this weekend.

Also, on Monday, I will schedule a 10-minute meeting to discuss changes to the roster. If that's okay, please let me know.

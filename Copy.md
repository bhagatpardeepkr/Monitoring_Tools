Thank you for your detailed observations from Edwin's session regarding our on-prem Dynatrace installation.

Yes, our team handles all updates manually to align with our scheduling and resource planning. I'll confirm the timeline for the next upgrade after discussing it with our team, considering the upcoming SaaS conversion to minimize any service disruptions.

Should the upgrade be delayed until after the SaaS transition, we'll communicate this well in advance to ensure all teams are prepared for any monitoring interruptions.

We'll keep you updated throughout the process. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

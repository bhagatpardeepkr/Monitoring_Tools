Proposal: Alternate Day Stand-Up Meetings with SMEs
Objective
The aim of this proposal is to establish a structured and regular communication channel through alternate day stand-up meetings with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). These meetings are designed to enhance collaboration, streamline project updates, and address any technical challenges promptly.
Background
Effective communication is crucial for the success of our projects. While daily stand-up meetings are a common practice, meeting every day may not always be necessary or efficient. By scheduling stand-up meetings on alternate days, we can ensure that updates remain relevant and focused without overburdening team members.

I see that there is still no progress on the CTASK for this change. I have already reached out to every user individually to close the CTASK. However, going forward, please ensure that we ask users to close the CTASK immediately after the implementation time. Otherwise, this will become a blocker for us and prevent the change request from moving to the review state. Additionally, we continue to receive reminders from the ITSM tools if the status is not updated from implementation to review.

Note: It is the ticket owner's responsibility to ensure users close the CTASK on priority.
